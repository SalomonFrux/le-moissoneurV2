# Scraper Service Improvements Summary

## Changes Made:

1. Fixed the Playwright browser launch configuration with proper error handling
2. Added proper Xvfb display server setup in our Docker container
3. Implemented automatic fallback to Puppeteer if Playwright fails
4. Added additional browser dependencies to our Docker image
5. Updated browser startup scripts to improve reliability

## Recommendations for Better Performance:

1. Consider using a higher memory allocation for your Cloud Run instance (at least 2GB)
2. For more complex scraping, consider using a dedicated virtual machine instead of Cloud Run
3. Implement caching strategies to reduce the number of database queries
4. Optimize selectors to extract only necessary data to speed up page processing
5. Add more robust error handling and retry logic for network failures

These changes should significantly improve the reliability of your scraping operations, especially in the Cloud Run environment where resource constraints can be challenging.
